Unlike \"grey\" WhatsApp integrations, this one supports the Coexistence feature, allowing businesses to connect an Altegio account with the official WhatsApp Cloud API. The API is typically used for automated messaging in Altegio, while the WhatsApp Business app is used for manual messaging. Coexistence lets you use both simultaneously with the same phone number.\n\nGeneral benefits\n• Previously, it was impossible to use the two services together using the same business number. Switching from WhatsApp Business app to the WhatsApp API often meant informing customers of a new WhatsApp number or account, potentially causing confusion or loss of contact. Now, with Coexistence the customer sees no change – they continue messaging the same business number and message history, with all past context intact.\n\n• Messages sent or received through either platform are synced in real time, so staff can reply from whichever tool is more convenient while keeping a single, consistent message history. This setup provides more flexibility and smoother communication management.\n\nOpportunities\n• Set up automatic notifications via WhatsApp to be able to:\n• Reduce no-shows with timely appointment reminders\n• Drive sales with updates about discounts and special offers\n• Strengthen customer loyalty with personalized birthday greetings\n• Keep clients engaged with review requests and repeat visit reminders\n\nRequirements\n• A paid Altegio account (any plan).\n• WhatsApp Business app (version 2.24.17 or newer).\n• A Facebook Business Portfolio (or create one during setup).
